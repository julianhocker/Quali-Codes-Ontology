# Quali Codes Ontology
This describes the ontology I developed for qualitative coding frames. This ontology describes qualitative coding frames. It can be implemented easily. I kept the representation simple in an table, but might provide a version in RDF in the future. This is still work in progress, I also do some user testing on it. But if you encounter issues or have remarks I am happy to hear from you. Also if you want to implement it into your research data repository, I am happy to hear from you

## Structure
The ontology consists of several entities: the metadata for the codes, the metadata for the coding frames and also metadata to describe the research data that was analyzed, the publications that were created as well as the projects in which the coding frames were developed

## Coding frames
|Name   |Description   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |

## Codes

## Projects

## Publications

## Research data
|Name   |Description   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|DOI   |The unique identifier of the data|   |   |   |
|Project|In what project was the data created?   |   |   |   |
